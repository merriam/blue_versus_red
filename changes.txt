CHANGES:  Adding the crafty.js and crafty-min.js files

Your webpages references crafty.js as a JavaScript library stored as plain text.  The library runs about 5,000 lines of cryptic code and 5,000 of comments that generate the reference manual (http://http://craftyjs.com/api/).  This crafty.js should be the latest version downloaded from http://craftyjs.com.

The file craftyjs-min.txt is 'minimized' from crafty.js by taking out comments, indents, and shortening variable names to make a faster download from production sites.

You can explore the github repository (https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty) for more details on minimizing, current bugs, and building the reference manual.
