CHANGES:  Add red and blue block entities with components for display and movement. 

The play area now has a yellow background.   Then I added two "entities":  red block and blue block.  The components add sets of behaviors to each block.  The red block has these components: 2D to make it a 2D object on the canvas and to give it the x, y, h (height), and w (width) attributes; DOM to animate using a DIV in the DOM; and Color to give it a color and the color() method.   The blue block also has multiway to give the block movement in four directions including mashing keys for diagonals.

Also added a yellow background to the game area.
