CHANGES:  Adding readme.txt

Yes, you found the change file!  Good for you!

The first commit here adds the readme.txt file that explains the purpose of the whole exercise.  GitHub requests adding a file with this name as an overview of each repository.  There is also the default .gitignore file with tells the git source control to ignore backup files and the .gitattributes for rules about merging project files.   The .gitignore and .gitattributes are just the default files generated by github for every new repository.
